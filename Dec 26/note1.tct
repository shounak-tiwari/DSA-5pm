What is DSA?

Data Structures: Organized ways to store and manage data to enable efficient access and modification. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, etc.
Algorithms: Step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. Examples include sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, graph traversal methods, and dynamic programming techniques.


Why Learn DSA?

Efficiency: Enables the creation of programs that are faster and consume less memory.
Problem-Solving: Improves analytical thinking and the ability to solve complex problems.
Industry Relevance: Fundamental for software development, competitive programming, and technical interviews.


Key Concepts in DSA:

Time Complexity: Measures the time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input (e.g., O(1), O(n), O(log n)).

Space Complexity: Measures the amount of memory space required by an algorithm.
Abstract Data Types (ADTs): Logical description of how data is organized (e.g., lists, stacks, queues).

Applications of DSA:

Search Engines: Efficient data retrieval and ranking.

Social Networks: Graph algorithms to find connections and suggestions.

Gaming: AI pathfinding algorithms.

Databases: Indexing and efficient query resolution.

Structure of Study:

Basic Data Structures: Arrays, Strings, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists.
Advanced Data Structures: Trees (Binary, AVL, B-Trees), Graphs, Heaps, Hash Tables.


Algorithms: Sorting (Merge Sort, Quick Sort), Searching (Binary Search), Greedy Algorithms, Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming.
